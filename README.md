- ⚡ Fun fact: ... The "Ransomware-as-a-Service" (RaaS) model has become popular among cybercriminals. This allows hackers with little technical knowledge to "rent" ransomware from developers in exchange for a cut of the profits. It's like a subscription service, but instead of streaming movies or music, you're distributing malicious software! This business model has made ransomware attacks more widespread and accessible to cybercriminals
